            <p class="p-2">Once you have created a project and entered you will se the title of the project an empty list of Endpoint and the Database Configuration
                for creating a Endpoint click the button "Create Endpoint" when you click a form will appear at the center of the screen

                This are important things to know when you are filling the new Endpoint Form
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">
                1. URL is the name of the endpoint for example getProducts, insertArticles etc...
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">
                2. in the SQL Query if you want to add parameters to it you need to put a '?' where you want to pass the argument always with space between the '?' and other characters <br>
                for example: <br>
                SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ? <br>
                INSERT INTO table VALUES ( ? , ? ) <br>
                DELETE FROM table WHERE id = ?
            </p>
            <p>3. The params need to be writed in a special way this is an example "param1:int,param2:string" you need to put the param name and declare the type string or int the param1 needs to be the column name of the table, if you want more than 1 you will need a ',' to separate each param but wihout any spaces  </p>
